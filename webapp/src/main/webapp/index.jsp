                <article>					
                    <p>Transitioned from being mechanical engineer to software engineer by learning how to code the traditional way – reading books. “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java” by Robert Lafore, “Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles” by William Stallings and “Computer Organization” were instrumental in helping me understand the evolution of computers and the way we code.</p>
                    <p>Pursued Master’s Degree in Computer Science from Wright State University and was privileged to have attended lectures of Professor Martin Rizki and Professor Jack Jean, although I faced many difficulties in coping up with classes, I was guided by the best at WSU. </p>
                    <p>Months later, I found myself developing android mobile applications. The first two decades of this millennium evidenced swift evolution in Android versions and there were constant requirements to update myself with latest features and technologies.</p>
					<p>Feeling the need to explore new horizons in Aerospace/Aeronautical industry where software skills could be utilized, found a position at Safran Engineering Services India, leaders in the market. </p>
					<p>My active participation in coding exists away from work as well. Helped several friends develop website for their businesses. Completed several personal home automation projects using Arduino such as timed watering system for garden and automatic lighting system using infrared sensors.</p>
					<p>So, now, a new journey begins as the path in front of me is directing me back towards becoming a java developer and I am excited by the vastness of the field and the tremendous scope it has to those who are willing to learn constantly.</p>
